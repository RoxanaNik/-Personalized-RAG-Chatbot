The Paris Agreement, also known as the Paris Climate Agreement, is an international treaty adopted at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21). The main goal of this agreement is to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius...

Pad around when I get home
I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
A greater woman wouldn't beg
But I looked to the sky and said
Please l've been on my knees
Change the prophecy

One of the things that happens in Iran regarding the outside world is that foreigners follow all the rules and we Iranians are uncultured. But in my opinion, this precision is not accurate. Because doing a series of things here can have very bad consequences for a person, therefore the other party does not even risk getting involved.

One more thing that I let go of in my life is striving for being the best and perfect. I try to be very good, but it seems to me that as it doesn't have 100% in the statistics, my life is like that. Nothing is supposed to be perfect. It can get very close to it but it won't reach it. Like graphs :))
I knew that both men and women had to serve in the Israeli army, but I didn't know that whenever they were told to return, we needed them and they had to go back again.

I really think about it, it's unbelievable, I don't know why :)) Imagine your life is good, the country is relatively good, then someone comes and says you have to wear a hijab, music is banned, everything is prohibited, then you're forced to flee.

Personally, I really couldn't stand living in Iran. For example, last night at the concert, I kept feeling bad and all I could think about was what we couldn't have. Then when Avi put on his young film, resonated with the way things used to be, my heart ached for that generation who lost everything.

These days, everyone seems to be working against the Indians. I'm afraid one of them will rise up like Hitler and say they count us as insignificant and that will be the end of us. Then they are too many, each can kill 7 people, the rest is just a matter of time.

It's done, it didn't work, but I'll be back. I'm going to live in Hormuz :))

I really fear I'll be kicked out of here :)) I imagine myself coming back to Iran, standing in my room...

These Kashas scream in my mind.

When I socialize with foreigners, my self-confidence increases. They compliment me on everything. 😂😂😂 It's true they're insincere, but still. 😭💔 Iranians (not all) often make you feel inadequate. 😂 Whatever you say, they say it's nothing or everything is normal for them. 😄
Seriously, I can open a restaurant now. 😂😂😂
Comment to get the recipe for number one. 🧸
In my teenage years, they used to say in twenty-five years, I'd be a full-fledged adult. 😂 It's almost a year left. Hopefully, by then, I'll be a full-fledged adult. 😂
If I had a passport, I would have taken a different path in my life. :))
I won't be at ease until I get all the visas in the world. 😂😂😂 What a good passport we didn't have. 💔
I become a bit bad with very few people in my life. But those I became bad with should forget all our mutual friends and acquaintances because they must be sure that I have enough reasons. 🥰
I don't know why I love stories like this so much. 🥹
I detest people who nitpick and look for problems in everything. 🙄
Isn't Canada under England's supervision? So why do we have to get a visa to go there? 😒
I'm happy for my friends' success more than my own.
I bought these devices. You connect them to electricity, do something inside, and it smells nice in the house. 🔅 10/10

I was thinking that Tyga doesn't know that she has immigrated. 😭😭😭 My child has no idea about anything. 😭
Tyga knows how much I love her or not. 😭
My favorite Iranian ceremony is Yalda night. 🍉
People reveal themselves through their words. For example, I recognized someone who had an emphasis on my authenticity. Later, I realized that this person's whole personality was an act. 😄
I am really in love with Tyga. 😭😭 I love her more each day. 💔
Tonight, we made chocolate cake with olives. :)))
Life after immigration is nothing like Fatemeh Zahra's life.
One of my friends has immigrated again for the second time, this time getting a studio. I asked him how it feels to live alone, he said it's not bad, but he preferred living with two people. One of them was someone he used to have tea and chat with for two hours. I told him whenever he wants to have tea, we will have tea together in the facetime. 🫂🥹
I watch videos of Syrians who are happy and tearful because they want to return to their country. It breaks my heart. 💔
Even in my friend group, no one is following news or Twitter. I always update them. 😁 Today, one of my friends was talking to his dad and said, "I heard on Rexana BBC that Bashar al-Assad has fallen." 😄
Today, I explained to several people the meaning of "the apple of the eye," and they really liked it. 😊
While my colleague noticed me wearing a scarf on a mannequin, he understood that hijab is mandatory in Iran. He was bewildered and kept saying, "I can't believe it." 😄
I put a scarf on our mannequin for display. 😄 Who would have thought one day knowing how to tie a scarf would come in handy?
The French have high knowledge about Iran compared to others. Generally, the ones I encountered were well-informed about Iran's situation and admired Iranians' courage. In contrast, many Canadians only know about Iran and Iraq. 😄
Whenever my mom sees how broccoli is washed, she sends it to me. 😄 Once she sent it, and I understood, darling.
Now that Syria is also in turmoil, who's next? :))
Tyga is surprised to see herself. 🐱

I found an app for job searching like Tinder, swipe left or right on jobs.

I had no clue about that. Interesting🤔

I want to save up money from two people and message Uniqlo to pay me to advertise for them😂

Out of all the things in my life, I didn't bring luck, but I brought a cat. The best thing in my life is my child.

Sometimes, I think about the side effects of characters in my life and marvel at the strangeness of the world.

My mom, I don't even eat fruits myself, let alone giving fruits to Taiga;))))))

During a philosophical debate between three of us last night, we concluded that the only happiness for Iranians is their friends.

I listen to the song "Disloyalty" and think of Iran; a romantic song about betrayal :)

I had a classmate at university who was really good at a subject and genuinely made an effort to study. This poor unfortunate guy was the top student in the class, then during award time, they introduced the second student and gave the top prize to a friend whose father financially supported the university :) I still remember it, it drove me crazy.

You praised Sharif University too much, now I really want to go back to Iran, study another Master's degree at Sharif, then return to Canada or somewhere else :(

Whenever I remember my grandfather's proficiency in French when I was in Iran, I feel embarrassed.

Once I find a job, this can be completed and I can claim it😬

When I was in Iran, at the age of 21, I had never watched 21 Iranian movies in a row :)) Now I feel like, why don't I watch Iranian movies, "Go watch an Iranian movie," they're telling me. Friendship's round :))

My mom sent this to me and has no idea what LCBO is :))))))

My laptop has not connected to the internet for some time, I wish the Wi-Fi comes back soon.

At night, it comes and sleeps next to me like this and says, "I'm cute, give it to me"🥹

I wonder how the singer Nazanin feels that after all these years, her song has become so trendy worldwide.

I had never thought about it as an option before :))

Today, a lady asked me where I was from. I said Iran. She asked, "Haven't you missed your family?" She emphasized it several times. She said, "Surely your mom must miss you a lot :(." It makes me sad.

Wish I were rich :(

A lady told me her Canadian nationality is great after talking to me for a while💃

France has piqued my interest, I want to go there, tear up the diploma in a few years, and they said sit down, Shatrujit😂

In my top 5 playlist songs, I have Sabrina Carpenter's "Sue Me" :))))))))))))))))))) It's impossible, man, impossible

I bought a coffee maker that keeps your drink warm for hours😭😂 You need a doctorate to be able to consume it.

Today, with my shoes, I tripped on the stairs in front of the house :))))

Before, when it snowed in Rasht, I used to dance in joy. Now, whenever it snows, I'm like "Oh no, again?"😭😂

Today, finally, I made my resume relatively good and posted that I defended it on LinkedIn. Now, who's going to hire me? Stay tuned.

Being 23 was one of the most challenging and bizarre years of my life. Full of new experiences :) Roksana, 24, has changed a lot, really.

A man came with an elementary school kid and bought an eye-catching bracelet for his wife's birthday. He said, "Put it in the gift box, it's my wife's birthday gift" and left. I don't even wish such a husband for my enemy.
If you had told me 2 and a half years ago that I would be in this situation, I would have thought you were on drugs.

It's been a week and a bit that I'm so sick I can't move. My throat has been sore for a few days. A few minutes ago, when I tried to swallow a pill, the water in my hand was insufficient, and the pill got stuck in my throat. Then I tried to drink water, but I was choking. I realized water wouldn't help, and I was really choking. In short, I used my hands to push my throat to get the pill down.

I understand what this user means. But the point is that one should not compare oneself to others. Secondly, if we see something others have and we don't, it could indicate our inclination towards those things, and then the next step is figuring out how to achieve them.

I had been away from Twitter for a while, but after graduation, I needed a break, and now I'm back to put up with my rants :))

Well, I turned 24 today :)))) I will tweet about it today.

If you want to pop a balloon on my profile 🥰

I connected with a foreign group for the first time in my life a couple of months ago 😭

These posts my mom sends me: [Link]

"I'm in the 'well, whatever' mood. Now, even in my mind, I said you tweeted this, so what."

If this actually happens, I could turn into violins :)))

Always plan B independent :)))

Life shows me strange things :))))

Be like Google Maps.

Once I fix myself, they're gonna miss me.

I want to go to the monastery, become a spiritual sister, my light lifestyle suits them.

Foreigners still don't feel real to me 😂

Social relationships are not my biggest strength.

My nail broke, I fixed it like this, and made $9.

Damn you for being a broken nail, damn you for this life.

I don't feel like talking to anyone, goodbye.

Since I remember, for a while now, there has always been a discussion about who should set the table:))) Come on, let's all get along differently:)) Not everyone is supposed to be the same, their relationships differ.

I'm destroyed because I'm made in Iran. I've been involved in a lawsuit for five months :)))) Damn the cursed devil :)))))))) [Link]

Just like waves form and create ups and downs, it can make it beautiful. Now, with all the ups and downs of life, I have one reminder:)) There is hope even in the worst conditions.

I bought this perfume because the seller said it's very nice and smells good, but it smells like dead dog :)) Don't be fooled.

In a month, it's my birthday and I want to write down some of the things I did at 23 for you ✨

Gogo was so beautiful in youth.

I always feared getting a tattoo and regretting it, but now whenever I see my tattoo, I love it more than before.

The next chapter of my life is coming 🐎
Not cool enough for cool kids, not nerdy enough for nerdy groups.
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart.

An ad came to me, "If you are old like me and not going to school this season... what do you mean?"

I saw a cute cat in a washing machine on Instagram, and when they turned it on, the cat got sick 😭

Maybe I need to disappear again.

Why can't I sleep? These thoughts won't let me.

I wish my friends had kids sooner so I could be the cool aunt who is living abroad.

Today my friend came to see me, sat next to me for half an hour, and I was so lost in thoughts that I didn't realize and ended up calling her suddenly, and someone next to me said, "Roxana," and I was shocked 😂
Roxana 2016 would hate Roxana 2024.

I kinda regret it but it's fine who cares. I was ordinary, it bothers me.

I'm getting rich, going to Korea for something.

I haven't graduated yet and I keep getting university ads. They found out I want to remain a student forever 😭

I wish I had wings.

The next side quest I'm gonna do is gonna be fun, but will I recover from it? We shall find out.
Excellent fun til you get to know her.

I'm debating if I should be Cleopatra for Halloween or Katherine the vampire diaries.
Sometimes I think about life, I get shocked I don't know, I think everything is pointless Then I see it's real, then I see maybe it's pointless

- Chatgpt's assistant has a lot of bugs 😞 it keeps getting quiet in the middle of my sentences, why do you keep cutting off?
- I found an app called fashionpass, after subscribing to it for a month for a fee, you can rent 10 items and then return them. And if you decide to buy the clothes, you can get them with a 90% discount.
- When women suddenly start wearing high-waisted pants in movies and series, don't doubt that they are pregnant.
- Another strange thought that comes to my mind lately is to go to Rasht, take pictures with the municipality 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Seriously, what a ridiculous thought, it's like Parisians taking pictures with the Eiffel Tower although they are not comparable, but you get the point.
- I'm done with this RBC bank.
- Really good show after a long time, I saw an interesting series. Watch "Osmosis" for sure ✨
- It's been a long time since I had anyone to share my worries with, I'm sad.

- I remember once in high school, I passed by Gilan University and we were like that, I could come here one day, then I went there, I wanted it to finish. I was very happy to go to Canada, then I came back and now I want to escape, what's wrong with me.

- About a year ago, a makeup artist messed up my hair, and I still feel bad looking at the pictures.
- Whenever I see Tyga, I think, if it wasn't for him, it wouldn't be anything:))))
- Even here, a picture of Fesenjan got more likes than my picture in Paris:))))
- This Iranian girl who went to live in the jungle with her Dutch partner thinks it looks interesting:))) They look very beautiful visually.
- "Before Sunrise" (1995) directed by Richard Linklater.
- Every day, like a morning bird, I get up early without an alarm.
- I wish I had the money to buy all the clothes on my wishlist :(
- Today, I finally went out of the house:)) I walked to the library.
- Chat GPT wrote me a sports program; now I'll try it to see how it is:))
- The French series I'm watching is about putting something in your brain and then scanning it to find your perfect match:))) Interesting.
- Normal was to keep moving, always leaving, never being anywhere long enough to give anyone or any place the chance to make me want to stay.
- But my foolish heart would hope anyway. It didn’t know how not to.
- I liked my life—the traveling, the money, being spontaneous and always having a new destination to look forward to. I didn’t want to stay here. I didn’t want to stay anywhere.
- I was glad I had Emma here. It was a distraction. Something to look forward to when pretty much everything else was awful.
- “So you don’t think that’s weird? That you can’t ever act like you actually live somewhere? That you’re always ready to take off on a moment’s notice?”
- I read a romance novel with a yellow mood a while ago, but it had some dialogues that I liked; now I'm coming to annoy you with them.
- The day I realized that straight hair doesn't suit me, and I shouldn't treat my hair as if it's straight and keep combing it, was a turning point for me. Because now when I look at old pictures, I see that it really gave me a bad appearance.
- I searched for "my vibes" on Pinterest and found these for me.
- This Iranian girl who went to live in the jungle with her Dutch partner thinks it looks interesting:))) They look very beautiful visually.
I had read so much here that I thought Canada was expensive. Before coming here, I had bought hair clippers to become self-sufficient and not pay money to the salon for a haircut 🤣

Feeling like I have been the wrong place at the wrong time most of the time, maybe there is a reason for this, I don't know.

In the new season of White Lotus, they refer to losers back home:)) I feel like they are kings, unlucky people who leave America and go to Thailand 😬

It's correct that actors are always praised more, but I always think about the writers 🤨 who have to be careful about everything to be able to write these scenarios.

I want to go back to Paris... 😭

I saw my friend had baked Barbari bread so now I want to bake Barbari bread too.

I just want to see Anesthesia, dear God 🙏

I want to watch a thrilling, meaningless series like Vampire Diaries 🦎 Any recommendations?

I saw this and remembered that day when my dad had bought a carpet with such a design and brought it home, then my mom used to stare at it every day saying, "Why did you buy a carpet with a cow design?"

These two years of living here have fully prepared me for complete home confinement. I haven't left the house for five days now 😂

I wish these days I hadn't wasted my time.

I shouted out my feelings for no reason.

More people liked the photo of Fesenjan on Instagram than my own photos :))))))))))

I really like the editing styles of indie films and vlogs.

Unfortunately, the bottom of the pot didn't come out completely clean. But the Fesenjan was 10/10 🦎

I wish when I return, the bottom of the pot comes back beautifully 🤔

I am in the kitchen since 11 o'clock :))))))

My Fesenjan has turned out really well 🎊

I am making the bottom of the pot with saffron rice, and I keep checking it fearing it might get ruined.

Maybe it's better to go to New Zealand, delete all social media, start everything from scratch, and never read the news again.

Are these signs? 🤔

Today's meeting, how will it go. I can't take it anymore. I'm tired. But I have to manage. Stop draining my energy.

Tigga is making dough...!

I'm going to become a flight attendant altogether.

The semester turned out to be 80 pages long🐈

Sometimes I say I want to die, but then I remember a movie and I'm like, "Oh no," and I say, "What if someone comes, sees me, and takes me away, figuring out I don't want to die :))))"

In the street where I live, there was a shooting, closing off the street. That's our luck too.

I hate literature review.

I wish instead of editing, I could acknowledge my literature review and make it more complete.

My life template is Khayyam. Mathematician, fun-loving, intelligent :))

I feel the most attachment I've ever felt in my life was at a statistics conference. Everyone there liked me a lot; the elderly professors would come and ask me questions, they would say, "Say whatever you want"🥺

One time at a conference, I saw an Indian person who was 25 years old and was about to finish their Ph.D. Now I saw on their LinkedIn that they went to Australia and became a professor. They were hired as a professor at 26 years old :))

My friend who went to Berlin, I told my other friend who is in Berlin to befriend them. What a matchmaker I am✨

I read a book a while ago written by a secret service agent about how to take care of ourselves, and he said wherever he goes, he always sits close to the exit so he can escape:))) Paranoia has become my sister's life!

My dad had blue eyes, and the biggest regret of my childhood was why my eyes were not blue😭

Every time I go to Starbucks, I remember that video in Starbucks:))))

Today I was feeling down, so I thought I'd put on a different eyeliner to feel hopeful and then go to the library:))

✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨

One thing that stands out to me is that here people freely praise and admire each other. For example, if they see you, they say how beautiful your clothes are, how nice your makeup is, how pretty you are, and then they leave or become friends with you while constantly praising you :))) But Iranians rarely do that.

My professor recently got a new student from America in our village. It really makes me wonder why :)))

Every time I go to the library, I throw the key and feel superior to the other students in our office 🤣

I used to think Iranians were very traditional people until I met the French :))

She always wants to prove that I am very lucky and she has been very unfortunate. Dad, it's my fault you didn't have money; you went and got married and had a child, shouldn't you spend on them? :|

Actually, I was reading a book by Roman Gary a while ago where the translator wrote in the intro about his life. It said Roman Gary once hoped to get a promotion in New York and go to Tehran ;)))) Imagine if you get a promotion and go from New York to Tehran!!!!!!

This Nigerian classmate of mine said he hadn't seen me in a long time and wanted to send me a message to ask about my well-being, but if I send him a message in 2024, he won't respond until 2025. Yeah, it's clear you respond late because you're very nosy and curious 😭

You can actually see how people have different ways of thinking; it's very surprising. For example, I was talking to a Canadian once about universities, and he said York University is known as Fork University :)) He said if anyone can hold a fork, they'll get York! Then I thought to myself and to many around me in Iran ...

Adel seems very kind; I want to hug him.

My brain can't accept the flaws of humans. That's why at night they come in my dreams and apologize, and I forgive them every time :)))

I was telling my mom about a misdeed someone did to me, and when I returned, my mom said, "Oh, we raised this child in virtue, and look where they've gone."🤣

This destiny swapping story is interesting. It says some people come into your life and constantly praise you, then try to take your place, become like you, and then eliminate you :)) They wanna be you they don't want to your friend. In short, be careful.

My close friend got accepted into a good university in Canada 😭 Since morning, he's been saying, "I can't stop imagining us living in the same country once again." In the life we've created, it's always "if only" and regret :)

I wish I was in Paris now, but here I am stuck in a village :)))))

There's a guy on TikTok who works in finance, he comes screaming every day that he hates his job, then after work, he buys a cake, comes on TikTok, and does a review 🤣

Once I talked with a foreigner about visas and passports, then on Instagram, he sent me a video saying if you invest $1 million in Malta, they'll give you a passport, then wrote, "In my opinion, it's worth it :)))" Oh why didn't I think of it myself.

Once we were talking in a group of compatriots. Suddenly, someone came back and said he wanted to study medicine and return to Iran because of the respect they give to doctors in Iran, unlike anywhere else. :)

Life is really strange; as kids, everyone used to say medicine, medicine, medicine is the best field in the world. Then I went to one of our relatives' homes a while ago, and they told me to talk to their kid to convince him not to pursue medicine and instead learn programming and such :))

I despise labeling everything.

Cats never get old for me. I've been watching cat videos for years and I really enjoy them 🤣

I've saved a bunch of memes about theses and graduation 🤣

Lana Del Rey looks like she's 25 even though she's 39 😭

The song in that era was ahead of its time. Seriously :))) What should we say about this era now, Cambyz dear 😂

The song "Khoshgela" should make you dance; it uses manipulation techniques to get you moving. It means if you don't dance, you're ugly.

I don't wish bad for anyone in this world. But if someone who ruined my life goes through hardship, I'd be happy :))

"We all had new iPhones but no one had no one to call."

I get scared whenever the song "Fitter Happier" by Radiohead plays.

The library attendant comes in at night and checks everywhere, today he greeted me because he saw me a lot today :)))

Today I was a bit tired of studying, then I remembered that girls in Afghanistan can't study, and I said sorry for you. I went back to studying.

Once a while ago, I was discussing with one of my friends, and I couldn't understand what happened. I told them that I took my programming class in Iran with paper and pen. The way they looked at me as if I was crazy :)) That's when I realized things were a lot worse than I thought.

And that feeling that gives you comfort, you always want to experience it again. It's like a drug.

Every day I thank God for studying this major; nothing gives me peace like numbers and coding. It's completely explicit; it has rules, if you don't understand the rule, you're wrong. What about human relationships? They have no rules. People don't know what to do. I'm happy with the computer 🤣

I found an article on ResearchGate and posted it as an article on LinkedIn for myself :| Since when did LinkedIn posts become academic sources?

Come and watch this series I'm watching; a pregnant woman is dead for 8 months, and a man proposed to her, but she said no because she's pregnant. That's no reason for us to get married. What does that mean? The man got upset and left. I would have been upset too.

There is always a reason behind everything, and it's really interesting for me. For example, one reason why most people find French accent attractive is that historically, the French had more power and influence in the region in recent centuries, and people subconsciously get attracted to power, so the French accent has been more attractive.

My opinion on distances has become very strange; for example, if it takes 10 hours to get somewhere, I say okay, it's nothing :))

Our relative bought a house in Canada and then told my grandfather not to buy a house in Canada at all :)) Alright, bro, thanks for the good advice; I already had a million dollars sitting in the corner of my bank account. I was just about to buy a house in downtown Toronto or Richmond Hill :))
iOS 18 is very interesting
Sometimes I think I haven't done anything in these two years but I have:)) I was in a T.A. program for two years, did a project with the Canadian government, got straight A+ in all my courses, wrote a 62-page thesis and still writing, did a bunch of class projects in this field they call hot water heating😭😂
The day you realize that no one truly cares is a sad day, but it seems like a big wake-up call :))
I am no longer at the undergraduate level at Koofti Gilan University
So many things happened this year that I feel like a different person now :)) https://t.co/b0vQE2d8ix
😭😭 God, how is it possible. Please keep these people away from me. https://t.co/YYRFOmL2hy
I think about my uncle almost three or four times a week, how he saved up money just to be able to call my grandmother for a few minutes, and then my grandmother quickly talked and then hung up so my uncle wouldn't spend too much money on calls. Thank God I can at least talk to my mom on Facetime.
You will never ever have a genuine friendship with someone who has a victim mentality towards everyone.
My Canadian classmate who came a term before me still hasn't finished his thesis and he took leave this term saying the program has been tough and needs recharging. Comparing myself to him is definitely a mistake, but well :)) If it were me, I think he would've been dead by now😂
One of my high school classmates went to America for high school and then went to UC Berkeley for college. I swear every single day without exception, he posted his location from Berkeley. UC Berkeley is cool, he's doing great there. It's just curious to me:))) Every single day
I have to renew my work permit :)
There's a method in the code that whenever you do something, there's an error and you don't understand what happened, they say delete the project and start over. I feel like I have to do the same with myself.
I used to say I want to be a university professor. Now that I've been a teacher assistant for two years, I realized nope :)) https://t.co/mjvOuIG27i

I try really hard to be strong, but some days I really struggle :)
I really want to experience that moment when I can go to different countries without worrying about visas or getting a visa.
Truly, my first and ultimate goal of migrating has been the passport :))
The things I do seem like pure madness to most people :)) but it makes me happy so ...
I'm okay with being the villain in your story if that makes u feel better for yourself
I really feel like I appreciate my belongings more every day. Really you only miss something when you don't have it anymore it seems.
Every day I become more of an adrenaline junkie :))
I read the comments under Netflix's post that they renewed "Emily in Paris" for a new season and I couldn't help but laugh :)
Yes, I lost 7 kilos, but I still need to become very thin. I wish I could lose weight faster 😭
I hate edited photos of myself.
I just realized that I complain a lot even though I'm 9500 kilometers away from home :)) But well, I'm really far now, that's a fact 😭
I wish this nostalgic feeling would decrease a bit, it's messing up my life.
In a few months, I'm turning 24 and I can't believe it.
Instagram reminded me that two years ago today, I posted a story from the club queue :)) How good it felt back then, are you feeling it too?

If I want something I will get it :)

I saw a picture from last year and I felt bad :)) I hope no one experiences depression.
Today, in the middle of thesis writing, I went to the gym, spent an hour on the StairMaster. I did a round the Milad Tower, then went to the sauna, and then back to writing the thesis 😭😂
Every time I open Instagram and TikTok, it reminds me of my bachelorette life. 😂 I'm so excited to work. At least I won't be broke anymore 💔
When I think about today's kids, it makes me emotional to imagine a world without phones and iPads.

I noticed that since I'm less involved in the outside world, I see everything as my job :))) I think people are like data, constantly giving me data so I can reach certain results. But it's not like that.

The podcast I was listening to said that we are genetically more attracted to people whose genetics are completely different from ours :))
Suddenly I remembered one of my Canadian friends telling me they chose this university because there are more white people there :)
Something I've been thinking about a lot lately is how we have lost culture in various aspects. For example, I lived in Rasht, but I don't speak Gilaki. It upsets me.
I really hate dramas with all my heart.

People I met while traveling &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
The motorcyclist I used to ride around the Hormuz with, we became friends, and even after three years, he still likes all my stories and replies saying he misses us so much. I swear if my friends text me saying they miss me, they never do it that much 😭
Just being in one place makes you accustomed to everything, when you go out, you realize how bad your situation was.

I really regret how I poured my soul into writing those 54 pages.

I love people a lot, but it seems like people don't like me much 💔
I'm sorry for myself that I haven't finished this damn thesis sooner. I'm torturing myself for no reason :)
If I write 16 more pages, I can officially say I've reached the desired page and it's time to revise :)
If my professor finds out I saved his PowerPoint slides and then shared them on Instagram, saved them together and killed himself.
Iranians who came with their parents abroad are on another level in delusion about Iran :)) I have nothing against them, they are really good people, but they have no idea of the depth of hardship :))

Let me tell you how poor I am mentally, once I saw one of my friends with a Rolex watch in one of their Instagram photos :)) then I poured myself down, I don't know why I thought Rolex was something very special for very elite and I don't know from these nonsense people :)) In my mind, regular people didn't have Rolexes 😂
I would love to go live in Montreal, but PR 😭💔

One of the things I think about is who added me to their schedule at what time. If it's true, my points are negative from stocking up 🤣
Emily in Paris is like I ask myself every 2 minutes why I'm watching this crap, but I keep watching until the end.
Rexana in 2024, Rexana now and doesn't know. I changed 180 degrees. And I like it.
The love of my life is this person. Really nothing in life has brought me as much happiness and joy as they did. He saved me and doesn't even know it.
If someone can introduce me to a dentist in Toronto who can pull out my wisdom tooth crookedly 😭😭😭😭😭
Okay, I went to the dentist, and he said he couldn't pull out my tooth :)
One thing I learned in these two years in Canada was that Iranian Twitter users in Canada were all truthful. But it seemed like I had to take those hits to understand 😂
The year 2024 was the weirdest year of my life 🤣🤣🤣
Well, maybe you won't believe it, but my problems haven't changed yet. I have to go pull out my wisdom tooth on Friday 😂 but this is my last wisdom tooth. Hopefully, I'll be relieved of wisdom teeth, God willing.
I took over a year off to cut you bitches some slack. Tell a friend to tell a friend that she is baaaaack 🤣

My cousin's profile picture is a picture of me and her daughter. He texted me saying he misses me :( The last time I saw him (7 years ago), he told me that I’m his closest cousin and he feels far from me :)) The way people change when they reach their twenties is different from those who were born there.

Summary of life in Canada: [Link]

Maybe what I truly want differs from what I think I want.

Someone came, didn't know anything, and would ask me to tell the answer formula. It makes me sad that I used to be like that before.

My mom is the most toxic person in my life. :))

Some people enjoy following the content of Walmart or wherever they go, and you wonder why you are not one of them. :))) They produce so much content about everything, maybe many people like it; it's not necessary for everyone to follow everything. Just live your life. Oh, anyone who goes to a page, they must be the audience.

I woke up at 7 a.m., made saffron tea, put on my fuzzy socks and warm robe so I can go meet the students today. 🙏🏻

I missed my friends a lot this week, going to Toronto to see them. 🥹

Not getting straight answers for simple questions.

The hardest pill to swallow is realizing people do not care. They'll hurt you and move on with their lives. Not even slightly...

More than what everyone might think, I am stranded, helpless, and unfortunate.

I wish I had died that night.

If people knew what situation I am in, it wouldn't have happened this way. My heart burns for myself; I wish I could die.

There's someone shouting on the street, "F*** death, f*** life, f***."

Taylor Swift stuns in New York. [Link]

Can I not make a fesenjan with the pomegranate syrup I bought?

If all my friends here were Taylor Swift fans, many of my problems would be solved. 💔

My landlord's name is Rabb but in Gilaki, it means "snail" - code name is Snail. :))

Yesterday, I was upset like a dog returning home, but once I arrived, it seemed like my brain had found peace. It's interesting how humans are.

Tyga quickly adapted to this environment and was very calm on my flight, which was very peculiar for me.

I sat down with the kids, ate booshar, shukurul, lavashak, and pomegranate syrup, and our hearts were longing for them. 💔 My heart was also longing for my friends here. 🥲

Today, I have a lot of work; I have to fill out a bunch of forms and go through new training. 😭 I can't find normal life anymore. 💔

When I arrived, I carefully put songs on my Spotify playlists from my downloads. It took a few hours for me to remember that here, Spotify is like a Pandora's box that opens up like a person.

I missed our van and the bathroom in our house a lot.

I have to go back to studying again. Oh, no... 😭

I'm back here; almost everyone is asleep at night. 😭 Night makes one's heart ache, but it's okay since Tyga is here, and our neighbor is coming.

What doesn't kill you won't make you stronger, unfortunately. It just makes you sadder and more broken, causing you to lose trust in a lot of things... 🙏🏻

My son also arrived safely. 😍😍 [Link]

After thirty-two hours of being stranded, I finally made it home. :))

I oriented myself to go Just do it in everything.

At the airport, someone sits in front of me with a Palestinian neck scarf and is busy with his activities. 🙏🏻

I went to my media, looked, and only posted pictures of beautiful girls and cats. :))) It turned out great.

One should come; let's go to the Olivia Rodrigo concert. 😭 Unfortunately, my brain can't handle it. :))) What should I do? Stay tuned with us.

Each farewell is harder than the last, always. 🥲 My heart longs for everyone so much.

Right now, when I wasn't here last night, Rasht only saw the polar twilight inside it. :)))

There are things I want to tweet and can't, and it makes me upset. I wish I had a more anonymous account. :)))

I have very intense emotions.

Tonight, I was able to convince the family not to post pictures of me on the internet anymore because they are embarrassed. 🙏🏻

I miss the dam for my car and driving in Iran. :))) 💔💔

I am gonna start a whole new chapter🙃

I will really celebrate Chinese New Year, not only because I am the one who gets dragged by my friends for various excuses, but also...

Hope the new year will have less *** moments, I don't really think so, a girl can dream at least I'll get my master's and say goodbye to the lessons.

*** life full of ***, last night we bought firecrackers along the way and enjoyed it to make the envious eyes leave.

I danced until five in the morning last night now I want to get it together and go dance a round dance in Tehran.

They don't appreciate my worth, if friendship turns into a memory, it's your fault.

It sucks to be the only cheerful one in a group.

To grieve deeply is to have loved fully.

When I was a kid and watched the "Hot n Cold" video, one of my fantasies was for someone to take me by the hand and go away.

I went to see a healer with my mom, he says if you keep doing this, they'll ban you and you'll be unlucky, he was trapped in his own words.

I woke up from sleep because of a toothache.

I have an assignment but I don't want to do it anymore, goodbye lesson for the next two weeks.

Finally, I finished the assignments of one of my courses with a teary face.

At midnight, it feels like a new day is starting for me.

Itself better to miss home than miss out on the world.

I only have one goal for 2024, just one.

Whenever I tell my grandpa I was with a therapist, he goes all quiet and then says, alright.

I don't know of any bigger red flag than irresponsibility in all human relationships.

Good night.

The least thing you could have done was to appreciate the things I did for you but none of them were enough and they will never be.

And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong.

And you always say I'm never satisfied.

But I don't think that's true, 'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you.

I hate to look at your face and feel that we are feeling something different.

I'm tired.

God rest my soul, I miss who I used to be.

The tomb won't close, stained glass windows in my mind.

I regret you all the time, I can't let this go, I fight with you in my sleep.

The wound won't close, I keep on waiting for a sign.

I regret you all the time.

And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down, You don't wanna know me now.

I needed the song "Now That We Don't Talk" in 2016.

I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy.

And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier, Fighting in only your army.

Frontlines, don't you ignore me, I'm the best thing at this party, And I wouldn't marry me either.

A pathological people pleaser, Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes, How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?

I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick.
I want to make your night beautiful with my beautiful tweets.
Tonight feels like one of those nights. 🙏🏻

Even my hunger strike reminded me of our dear country
Thank God💪🏼
Timothy's busy, he left with Kylie, I don't want to change my crush after five years :))
I'll let you know if it changes again🙏🏻😂
Why is everyone saying oh my 😂😂😂
Haircut in Rasht, where is the best place for a short hair cut?
Lucky rich people, instead of another, they raise their child, just take a picture with the other child and that's it😂 https://t.co/m6VXwjuNqP
One thing I fear is that I always used to think that well, if I just bear a bit more, this will end. What if I come to work one day and it never ends, ugh
Sorry, but no matter how much I think, I can't accept when a woman says wearing hijab is my choice :| and then says I'm a feminist. How could anyone think wearing something changes anything?:|
Sometimes I behave in a certain way, and then when I realize my mom did the same thing, I feel like setting myself on fire :)))))
RT @ShouldHaveCat: 😭😭 A week from now, I'll start this semester and my courses will be finished🙏🏻 You can do it, Roxana
When people can't convince themselves, they don't want a lot of things, but when they can have them, their opinion changes :)) For example, when I was in Iran, I would never pay more than 200,000 tomans for lipstick and would say no one goes to buy lipstick, people go crazy here :)) But now the lipstick I buy costs 45 dollars :))
One of the things that has become very dear to me is my beautiful car🥲 Where were you, my dear, that today I waited an hour to get a taxi and didn't get one
I'm supposed to bring my child back🥹 https://t.co/0gvtPoJYKQ
In 2018, I asked my nephew if he was gay, then he got upset and told my niece to ask for me, my niece said, "Roxana says I'm gay," and my niece came and said, "Why do you insult my child." Now she says she doesn't know if my child is a girl or a boy :| The ready-made set up tried to make me a fool, it was obvious, ugh😭😂
From seven, and I was waiting for a driver to accept me to take me to the dentist and they didn't come, and when I said this is a village, they said don't say that :))

One of my followers posted a story of ghormeh sabzi with wine🤨

Hello friends, I have a VIP ticket available for the Metallica concert (two-day concert in Toronto) for sale. If you are interested, DM me

Our teacher assigned our final project to create our own PT chat 🙏🏻 Thank God

Even though we had 800 students this semester, most of the time everyone was lazy, no one came to the class office to study. Thank you, God😂

Should I set fire to those who didn't congratulate me on my birthday?

The truth is I see no future anymore

Instagram pages of Iranian couples abroad are very interesting to me, it's the main activity for the partner to maintain the relationship 🤣

My heart is in my mouth :))) I don't know why I'm scared stupid

Quebec adds more and more ridiculous laws every day :)))

I feel like I'm becoming addicted to positive and negative energies :))

😭

After 435 days of migration, I have reached a place where I can officially say that if I want to celebrate my birthday, I can invite more people here than in Iran🥲

Today my laptop burned out and my university email got blocked because I opened a scam message

Thank God🙏🏻

My laptop burned out, guys :)))) Thank God🙏🏻

I picked up a cup and looked at the design and saw this

This is our luck

One of my friends here, her family and friends really like each other🥲 I had never seen this before, it's interesting :))

Who's coming🥲🥹

Today my mom said my grandfather has aged in this year and a half that I wasn't there, my heart breaks for him, God🥲

Pretty privilege in Iranian society is underrated and the discussion about it is scarce :)) it's very real, truly

I feel like love has expanded within me

I got surprised for the 6th year, God, I have really good friends🥲😭❤️

What should I do to make my birthday memorable?

It doesn't matter if you don't like Taylor Swift, not everyone is supposed to like everything, but actively hating and making fun of her success with sexist topics is what upsets me🙂

If I wanted to be someone in my life, I would like to be the rock

😭

Every time my birthday approaches, I get stressed as if a bomb is about to go off.. I'm getting old God, 23 what does it mean, I don't want to

Friends who have taken the Taz and are taking it, please give me some solutions, I'm very confused🤦🏻‍♀️ I don't know exactly what to do, what did you do to make your way easier?

It's getting late at night and I'm getting depressed🥲 I wish I was smart, would have taken the Taz and gotten an amazing score, damn, I screwed up, God, I feel like a trophy wife 🙃

I drank so much coffee, my heart is racing

I have a presentation in a few minutes💔

Only three weeks left, time passes quickly🥲

At 18, I had an Instagram page with 70k followers

RT @RhysPiecesss: Me a fully grown woman seeing any Taylor and Travis content 😂

I'm really happy for Taylor Swift 🤣
Some of you have always been in prosperity and comfort and truly have no understanding of the world of people without money and you insult them with your privileged tweets. I mean, what does it matter if someone goes to America, I don't know, just go spread goodwill in America only. Do not belittle others.
I wish my situation stabilized sooner, I'm tired of trying 😞

Enamel gets more stains from the rich hypocrites.

The high was 20 degrees today, it snowed :))

Thank God we experienced our first snow today! From a few days later, the white won't go away.

There were 50 "story pushers" on Instagram, my eyes are tired.

I can't take any more news about death.

I messaged a hair salon for hair coloring, they said it's $17. It's cheaper to color in Canada.

I hate this time zone difference, it bothers me a lot at night.

Why cry today? Death, sanctions, Israeli and Palestinian people, Armaita... plenty of options :)))

I offered my condolences to my aunt, she said, "Beloved, he loved you so much. He always said you saw him more than I did." 😔

Always thought why people bring flowers to the deceased, now I understand it's to satisfy themselves...

Still can't believe the biggest reason for buying Iran tickets was to leave the world.

Forgot to have lunch today because I was sad all day ✨

If you won't get me this, I'll be upset https://t.co/urXp62a7Xk

Every day is a struggle with myself to accomplish the smallest things.

The last time I talked to him, he talked back but I didn't understand. I sent a kiss emoji, he sent back a kiss. I wanted to tell him I love him, didn't say it, but I knew he knew 🖤

One of my biggest fears came true: someone stole our bicycle right in front of our house 🤦🏻‍♀️

Someone invited me to a Halloween party at last 🥲

I started the day with my grandmother's hospitalization and ended up crying at the gym 💪🏼

Has anyone bought the Hello Kitty perfumes? They look very pretty, but I don't know how they smell 🥲

I think I'm crazy, but others don't think the same, maybe they do, not sure :)))

I like GitHub a lot, I feel powerful every time I commit and push 😂😂😂😂

Even ordinary texts, I want to send formally to an informal person :)))

God, no matter how hard I searched, I couldn't find someone to solve one simple Sepall equation :))))

Oh God, all the papers I received are wrong! I can't give a low grade, my heart won't take it.

I get more frustrated every day even thinking about yesterday :)))

When someone asks me what I do in my thesis, I really don't know what to say because they're not supposed to understand :)) If I say my Interpolation Time Series Environmental Epidemiology, are you satisfied?

Canada is debating on providing allowances 😂

Every day, I get to know myself better and realize how big mistakes I made :))

Someone has requested to follow me twice this week, we have no mutual followers :|

I haven't gone to Iran yet, not planning to go soon, thinking about going back makes me sad :))))

Whenever you forget, Iranian girls are very nice, listen to Andy's song "Andi Dokhtar Irani" 😂🙏🏻

It's really getting cold, I can't take it anymore :)))

Every passing day, I realize more how far from my standards I've been :))
Something about me is that I really like to believe in people even if there are a million fucking reasons that they are going to fail.
Sometimes I doubt my sanity, and the thoughts that come to my mind confuse me.
I remember when I was in Iran, I used to think about the future and preferred to die rather than see my own future in Iran.
I remember until recently I didn't know what setting powder was. I still haven't bought it. I am such a fool.
This Iranian woman threw me off completely. I was just thinking why her name is similar to mine, then she said bye and I messed up.
I wish I had chocolate.
I sit like White Walkers watching reality TV and I like it. I hate myself for it.
Every day, I go see the doctor alone. I am not happy with being an adult, and I'm hungry too. I'm so annoying, sorry friends.
Yesterday, I slept at 3 a.m., woke up at 8, went to class, came home at 12:30, replied to some messages, checked the internet, slept at 1:30, and woke up at 3:15 a.m. Now I'm off to a camp and tired.
Today my teacher told me I had been programming since the age of 8. I asked him how is that possible? He said, "I WAS A HUGE NERD."
Such a first world problem, but today I was so tired. By chance, a blind man got on the bus with me, and I had to stand.
I miss Iranian morning pastries.
Who will jump with me from the Milad Tower?
The fact that until now they have not diagnosed my mental illness and tell me I'm healthy is strange to me. I need to do more testing because I do not feel sane at all.
It's true that I was upset today, but at least I don't live in Iran.
Today was one of the shittiest days of my life.
There is no bakery in our village. Banan-e-Rasht was so crusty. I come to Iran and eat bread every day.
I can't believe someone believes in a religion in the 21st century. Any religion.
I told my teacher how many papers should I correct?
He said, "You have 120 hours till December, so infinite." 😂
After two days of fasting, today in the morning, my hand shakes since I drank coffee.
Ed, is that you?
The best time to be up is from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Everyone is tired; no one comes. Thank me later.
I'm getting old, I sleep early at night and wake up early in the morning.
Even by studying like this, I can get my postdoctoral degree at 27 or 28, but I think I'll kill myself before that. So pointless.
Today my meal was painkillers, haha.
Today someone told me it's good that I speak English, but I have an Iranian accent. How do I get rid of this accent?
My dream was a disaster; one night I sleep at 11 and the next night I sleep from 3 a.m. till 5 p.m. the next day, then from 8 a.m. till 8 p.m.
I didn't have time to eat today.
My classmate who never sleeps at night just studies, tells me I won't ask you how you were during the weekend because I know it must be good. You're always studying and leave me alone.
I am upset about being similar to Muslims.
Life sucks when I have to get up at 3 am to do my assignments.
Every day I feel worse about myself.
Sometimes I think I'm very lucky, sometimes I think I'm very unlucky.
Today, I experienced a different kind of class distinction when friends wrote their family names as "Roeiz" while I wrote "Reno."
Once someone who was teaching me How to Drive asked me some personal questions, then at the end of the session said that he doesn't want money for the session. Haha.
I really want one of my Iranian friends to come to Canada and pick me up at the airport.
Today one of my foreign classmates was saying all Iranians are rich, and when he looked at me, he said all Iranians here except you are rich. 😂
I read statistics, so I know I'm not a particularly appealing model.
Yesterday, I kept seeing posters about Palestine and Israel at university. It was annoying me.
I went to watch Taylor's concert and it was really good, but I don't understand why the price should be higher than a regular movie, and even a bit more than ten dollars. 😂
Last week, I corrected nearly 500 ponds by hand :)) Where is my good karma?

I remember when I was a kid, my uncle would call my grandmother. After five minutes, they would talk for ten minutes because calling Iran was expensive. Then my grandmother would wait for her call for a long time and when she was talking to her, she was stressed all the time, saying cut it, it's getting expensive, my heart is breaking💔

Every episode of "Pashme Rezoon" gets fluffier

My brain dumped from the fourth section of perfect match :)))))))))

Normalize not forcing people to choose you. Let people do what they want so you can see what they'd rather do. If they...

Sometimes when I talk to my mom, I feel like I'm turning into her in the future :)))

#NewProfilePic

My heart longs for my kid. Where are you, my beautiful love😭

City has posted a drug use public service announcement and we can't tolerate it. Everyone poured under and pressed against it. Help fund this issue and provide housing for them. Although I love Taylor a lot, she is so overrated. Why is everything about her so expensive? Even her merch is the price of my father's blood. Why does her film cost twice as much as a regular film? Why does this woman kill and bury billionaires?

I was thinking about the past (ten years ago) and my standards were so ridiculous back then :))) The trashiest things possible were my standards

I hate adulthood :)) I saw a video where you had to go through a playground to enter a shop, and the first thing that came to my mind was how dirty that playground is :|

Even though I'm not fond of cars, this one is beautiful

Wishing a happy Thanksgiving to Hello Kitty :)))))

My mom sent me a post, reminding me to be kind to her as she is in this world for the first time. :))

Autumn is a really depressing season

Uno has an edition named "No Mercy." I think I might go crazy playing it with friends😂

But I really wish someone would take me to the bath, cook for me, let me rest on their lap for the whole day, and allow me to talk and cry

Avoiding people that continually trigger your mental health and lower your vibe is top tier self-care.

As a statistician, I feel attacked by "girl math"

I had a session with my instructor, he answered people's questions and stayed on Discord until midnight. Then he expected me to do the same as if I were his kid. Believe me, there is no one like you in this world

I corrected 350 ponds, 500 more to go💪🏼

Yesterday, I drove alone in a car and listened to my own songs and could confidently say, "fuck people." I love being alone all the time

I was having a session with my instructor, he changed my project because he said, "You can't handle it alone since our education system is bad and has made everything difficult for you, and I can't do anything for you." You jerk, this life and this country.

I charge one of my friends $80 every two months for a subscription, then he transfers the money to my account in Iran. Now I have 6 million in my account. I had never seen this amount in my account before

Today, after five minutes, I got to Duane Reade in Toronto, a lady pulled down her pants on the sidewalk

When your distress can't get any worse, you just become more hopeless. It means you are nearing the end

I'm happy that I'm going to see Tom Odell and Blenheim tonight

If not letting go was a major, I would have a Ph.D. in it
- I'm starting the first week and with enthusiasm in this life.

- Love is blind is very entertaining :))))))))
- Except for the dowry, nothing else supports women in the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Whoever says that dowry and divorce rights do not go together, must sing it in their ear because if a woman files for divorce, she cannot receive her dowry so they are not related.

- All friendships are not meant to stay intimate forever; when someone's behavior has changed and you are not responsible for this change, let go.
- Since I came to Canada, I only posted one post on Insta, from my memories in Iran 😂
- Tonight the moon is so beautiful✨
- For the first time at the age of 22, I drank so much alcohol that I tagged a few times :))
- I've had 8 shots of alcohol and can only say thank God I'm not in Iran right now
- I have a shopping list on Amazon for when I get rich I want to buy items from it 😂
- I have a strange feeling about Iranian culture, seems like subconsciously we are always looking for a problem or something :)) for example, if we have 100 x's and all but one are equal to 6, we search for the one that is not equal to 6 and try to prove none of the x's are 6, I don't know if you got my point or not
- Tonight was a strange night :))) I broke my own record of drinking shots, then we went to a club where our friend is a security guard and we were very intoxicated, everything was numb, my friend had a bottle and cigar in their hands, we went inside, our friend who was on security duty got scared, asked why we brought it, took it and quickly went to Beirut with it.
- After a long day, I'm going to a Taylor Swift dance party🦝
- Got accepted🍓
- 🥲🥲🥲🥲 I'm stressed, God why is life so stressful?
- Maybe this time I'll pass my driving test 🥲

- Thank you ❤️
- I pulled out my first wisdom tooth :))
- In the first five minutes of my class, my teacher said do not pay attention to the syllabus.
- I got them out of my ass and sixty percent of machine learning is bull :)))
- I have a certain image of you in my mind that froze when I left and it makes me wonder all the time… who are you now?
- Migration is such that all of a sudden many people come before you whom you have no data about. For example, you knew in Tehran that someone is friends with so and so, then…
- I miss my family I never thought that is something I would think about this much but here we are
- Friends I found in language class I love more than everyone else :)))) they are all so smart it's weird
- Last night until 4 am, I had a toothache and couldn't sleep :)
- "Existence" as an Iranian is hard. Let alone researching, writing articles, and progressing.

One of the worst qualities one can have is ingratitude. Even if you give them the whole world, it's never enough for them.
Yesterday we went to a restaurant, the downstairs was a club, then we went out and everyone was dancing in the club. Then the three of us came home, sat until 5 am, played two games :)))) I feel like I became one of those geeks in the movies.

This week, I felt a strong sense of belonging at the conference :)) I didn't think I would feel a sense of belonging among a bunch of statisticians and mathematicians.

I thought at 23 I would get my master's, what special ability do I have that people can't do until yesterday I saw someone at 25 getting a PhD with one year of work experience 🤣

Not being young anymore bothers me 💔 Seriously, the age of 3 is the peak of humanity.

Last night we went out with an Indian guy who had come from Saudi Arabia. He said he had never drunk with Muslims before :))))

At first, I got stuck in guidance, wanted to join the Basij, took a paper that families had to sign and took it to my father, and then he looked at the paper, looked at me, and tore it up:)) He said go home, never talk about these things again.

Today, I was chatting with a guy, I asked what his favorite movie was, he said godfather :))) then that scene with Barbie got stuck in my head.

Today I saw a professor, I found out he's from Iran, he said once he went to Iran for a scientific conference. Then he said to get acquainted with Iran, they took them to Qom to visit Khomeini's tomb 😂

They were talking about gun control and all, then he turned and said Canadians have laws and they follow them, then he looked around with fear and said there are some new cameras that...😂

Not an idiot and burnt out. At least watch the movie first and then come and criticize.

Sometimes I wish I had a friend here to do all the stuff I wanna do with :(

If you give any of them power, they destroy your life with their superstitions.

I hate all religions.

We're going on a trip with professors in a bus that has champagne on board :))))

First butterflies, then mental issues. Today's weather is really beautiful ❤️

Love is pain.

So far, I've helped two students, and they have thanked me a lot :))) I'm truly a people pleaser because I was really happy 🤣🤣🤣🤣

I really have no interest in any kind of substance :))) Once I was operated on and became unconscious, and I loved that feeling of unconsciousness so much, it keeps coming back to my mind.

Me every day: I wish I were rich.

I remembered a classmate who used to push themselves so hard, studying so much, and had a GPA of 17, then they got married :))) and became a homeowner.

They are so attractive, I can't concentrate: |

Thank God it's not cold anymore, the weather is warming up, and I can finally leave my hair curly without straightening it 🙏🏼

Have you ever had your beliefs and convictions shattered? It's like, "How can someone be so stupid?"
Good on paper but not in real life
No one had ever disrespected me so much, never brought me down so much :))) I'm really a fool. Every day I ask myself how am I in this situation??? How do I endure it???
I've never been so unlucky in my life :))) Life is truly interesting

Now that I'm watching my childhood cartoons, I feel more similar to adults :))) I've aged
Cartoons make me very happy 🤦🏻‍♀️
I hate everyone 🥲
Another person ate something from Iran that I brought and despite repeatedly telling them not to, they ate half of it. I don't want this anymore, and it bothers me. It's a very trivial thing, and I can't buy it here. After eating half, I got really angry and told them this annoys me, don't eat it. Then they returned and said, "What's the big deal, it doesn't matter to you."
Another one stayed at my house for 3 weeks, and now that they've gone back to Iran, their stuff is at my house. I asked them to bring me a 100-gram item, they said, "I don't know, I'll let you know." 🤣
Let me give you another example. One of them was at my house yesterday, and they ate half of something that had come from Iran and was very limited. They really lack common sense to such an extent.
One of the issues with migration is that you try to be friendly with people or have interactions with them that in Iran, no one even said hi to you.
One provides, and...
Every day, I understand more how foolish I am :))))
People in Iran &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iranian people in Canada
The other person was here for a total of 4 months, always shopping around, then said, "I get depressed," so their dad bought them a ticket to Iran for the summer. Now they're there saying it's much better there and such. :)))
They said, "Four years ago, I used to go to the club where a session cost 800 just for the entrance fee."
Me: |
I have never gotten along with very wealthy people, and I never will :))) It's like they are in a different world.
I loved having roommates like in movies and cartoons and having fun with them, but my roommates were the worst. One of them couldn't even look people in the eyes.

Last night, I was walking down the street for 12 nights, a van was coming straight at me, then suddenly turned and honked next to me :)) Then the thing that came to my mind was that they want to kill me to make it easier for me 🦝

Regarding this, professors who occupy $10,000 that were supposed to be deducted annually from my tuition fees and I lost them 🙏🏻 (Of course not all of them were occupied, 80% were, but)
In my personal opinion, based on my own experience, about the entrance exam and its relevance to migration, the GPA, language, field, and projects you did for migration are much more important and essential than the university. Universities don't differ much from one another. People in universities differ, and the better the university, the more successful people at least in it

I hate Taylor Swift.
In the end NO ONE cares about you😘

Last night I had a strange dream. A dream that felt like if I went back and changed something, what would happen :)

👆🏻 I have to submit this assignment, this semester is over.

From last night until now, 5 people have sent me raccoon videos on Instagram :))))

Today I miss Iran

Siyavash not reading his letter broke my heart 💔

I've been chasing buses so much in these past few months, I was chasing a dream. If there was a medal I'd have it

My two moods: https://t.co/BRmmWjJcnD

I got in an Uber, and the driver asked how I was, I said I'm good, how are you
He said I'm great, the weather is so nice, I can't complain :)))

Sometimes I just scroll Instagram trying to find a quote with a meaningful thing in it that can save me from my mystery.
I am sure I am looking in a wrong place for meaning

Canada has no middle at all, I think I'm dying from standing outside for two minutes

Stupidity annoys me :)

Maybe I'm petty but I enjoy seeing my enemies suffering

The interesting thing is that in my 21 years of life in Iran, I had never posted a photo or story with the Haft Seen table :))))) But abroad, there is a feeling that no, it matters and I had to do it 😂

And I want to be alone, I don't know if it's the right goal but I think it's what I need https://t.co/9xagjHE3WT

To everyone who says, "My grad school process was hard too, if you’re getting rejections, it’s OK, I got them too…" Sorry, i…

Emailed the professor, pray for a response, even if it's a rejection, but I need to know my fate.

I've made a decision. It seems like my mom wants to annoy me.

Friends, know anyone or any institution/person who provides online or in-person German language courses (in Rasht)? I would be happy to hear about your experiences as well…

He just came and said the grades were arbitrary, so I'll correct them by tonight. God help me. 😤 The whole class got a 9 🌟

One interesting thing is how everyone praises those who adopt animals, but when it comes to having children, they support those who are struggling to have their own and spend millions to help them.
Like ok, I really don't have a problem with someone wanting to have their biological child.

My family wants me not to be cared for
Someone teach the scum a lesson, his family will make him cry enough.
Who said we have good clerics? =)
We have a cleric in the family (unfortunately) who didn't steal anything or if he did, we don't know, but when his wife got sick and bedridden, he got a new wife who was even younger than his own daughter and that woman cried all her life and cursed that animal :]

- My friends, I wanted to buy the Easy Apply package for Fal 2022. It costs 440,000 tomans. If anyone is interested in sharing the cost and splitting the money, I would be happy.
- But real burnt generations, born in the seventies and eighties =))
- We had been on a trip with 4 tomans for a dollar; now the things I bought and see, when I convert them to today's price, give me a penny.
- Will you believe it or not, the importance of Middle Eastern news for the whole world in comparison to the death of just "one" black person in America, nothing.
- Friends, this is my first work on the TattooM page. I would appreciate it if you follow and support.
- My grandmother brought 14 children and lived to be 102 years old :))))
- Surah Nisa is enough in itself to question the whole religion and put it in occupation
- I received a lot of messages! More than the salary of 3 months! I can't bear not to tell the children.
- It gives the most crowded and full-of-mess service.
- Some really have more problems with their compatriots than foreigners...
- He posted on his story about Khuzestan, that's the situation and such bad news.
- Now he prays for Afghanistan. Is God here too? =)
- I really love...
- Really, the hatred has consumed all of my being.
- Then they say why are you nervous.
- Really, family has a significant impact on one's life. For example, my father had obtained a passport, his US affairs were fine (30 years ago). My grandfather says you have no right to have a passport, he would tear it up =).
- If my father were here, I'm sure he would help me in the process of going.
- My mother just throws stones in front of me.
- If you could understand the philosophy of Ashura, you wouldn't mourn; you would rebel.
- It's interesting to me that the Taliban are shown in a good light on TV, and they say we should respect all opinions.
- All debates, plans, dreams, needs, ideals, minimums, joys, and sorrows end in emigration. Yes, my homeland, it's like this.
- You see Afghanistan's fall, and no one in the world helps, nowhere is there for them, except a handful of vague promises of aerial support...
- I'm like this, I have an appointment at 6? Then I won't do anything all day tomorrow.
- Biden has been two-faced and fickle =)))
- Beautiful, everyone is being convinced.
- Who can replace young people like us who are 100 times more resilient than that army in chest-beating Husseini?
- In my opinion, those who after the events in Khuzestan still say Husseini Husseini are lacking in logic and faith.

Everything my ego had is gone

At least 14 people have been killed in the #Khuzestan protests, no name, no memory, no voice, it's hard to believe they were forgotten so quickly.

I'm looking for a place to stay for two nights a week in Hamburg. I prefer not to stay at a hostel and to rent from Iranian guys in Hamburg.

Psychological test for disorders
My counselor said she was surprised that you don't have depression at all :)))
Then my mom went to Italy for a few years having a good time and returned saying Iran is better and made me miserable :)))

If you have honor... if you have dignity, be the voice of the 10-year-old kids who are taken from their homes in Khuzestan.

Unfortunately or fortunately, I am not at all dependent on my family.

In Khuzestan, the internet is cut off, nightly detentions, transfer of detainees to unknown locations, detention of children continues, but...

Don't lose sight of the #Khuzestan issue in the #Protection_Plan news space. Khuzestan is still under pressure.

If you are a resident of the United States, what can you do with $5 a month? A coffee?

The country wants to develop more technologies to improve the speed of their internet, so they do not fall behind if it is cut off for a minute.

The ban on child marriage was not approved but the #Protection_of_Users'_Rights bill was approved. Then our people say Kimia Alizadeh should not have received those two bronzes that she got from the government and that she acquired them with the financial help of the Leader and has no right to object :)))

Unfortunately, the speed of the country's downhill is faster than my upload speed.

They made Saeid Mollaei lose before so he wouldn't have to compete against Israelis and ruined his sports career, now they falsely claim he willingly left and became the first Iranian to win a judo medal.

The people and the protesters should not be forgotten even with this internet shutdown. Should we buy a VPN that worked in November 2019?

Iranian 50-80 year olds are the most fearful people I have seen in my life; they are still afraid of everything.

When Kimia Alizadeh was representing Iran in the Olympics, instead of appreciating her, they questioned what's the point if a woman takes her legs?

The difference between us and the enemy is that in the enemy's country they riot for freedom, in our country they riot for water and food
The people of Khuzestan say: "We are thirsty, we want water"
Their response is tear gas, lead, and bullets.

I don't know why you all like to degrade everything's value. I really don't care about Sephora or anyone else. But this behavior, I don't get it all. She only does makeup and makes videos. An actor just mimics someone else and gets recognized. A programmer just codes. A teacher just teaches :/

I was watching a documentary about animals' lives at night; then there was a very tiny creature that had a serpent for food, almost like a mouse. Then a larger serpent comes to eat its two-week-old offspring, they keep jumping around. The little serpent is scared and flees 😐
The videos from 100 years ago that I watch all seem very surreal to me. I always think if the videos from 1000 years ago existed, how strange they would be.

I saw a documentary where a penguin was collecting stones, then another penguin stole all the stones, and when the female penguin came, he didn't give him any stones, went to the thief penguin to give him back the stone he had stolen :(( There are pieces of you inside me. I could lie say I like it like that. All I ever wanted to be enough for you.
Bad luck until 1404✌🏼. Any place in Iran under government supervision is considered occupied.

Experience has shown that whoever dislikes Taylor Swift has their own issues. Be careful, everything is toxic? Someone has taken a bucket of poison and poured it on all people and their relationships :))
Everyone I liked a bit in life taught me a lot.
I really love all my friends, even those who I've seen negatively in various ways.
At 18, I had three birthdays.

Very important advice for today: Never be surprised by anything, because the world spins so much that one day you find yourself doing the same thing you wondered about…

Don't trust those who say Taylor Swift owes them.

Why does the Sky Diving cost 3 million?

I made a mistake four years ago when I told my aunt not to vote for Raisi. Since then, she keeps sending me these kinds of texts all the time :)
I don't care about anything unfortunately :))
I don't know why it is that whenever I buy something, a few days later a huge sale happens.

Sometimes you have to put people in their place to understand who you are dealing with.
Once, when I was 12, someone suddenly sent a picture of their genitals on a cake. Guess what, I blocked them.
It has been a while since I've checked the people I blocked and found out later that I am now friends with the guy who had sent the picture of genitals.
Comparing childbirth pain to getting hit in the balls, I can knock someone out with my own hands.
I get jealous of people who take good care of their belongings.
My poor aunt has had disabilities ever since she was born, on the other hand, my uncle has undergone a kidney transplant. In short, they spend at least 4 to 5 million on her medicines and tests. After investigating, they said they would not give her the 2,000 they had previously given her as disability allowance anymore.
Unfortunately, I messed up my eyebrows with a video message I sent to my friends, but oh well.
I gave a test about feelings, half of the famous people who brought it were emotionally in pain, and half of the others were killing themselves. :)
Some people go to Disneyland to drown their newborns in the pool, complain to Disney, and get money while getting rid of their child.

My mom was talking to Tyga, saying, "You are my handsome grandson, I hope your mom's stepdad doesn't put you in this shape." :)
In my grandmother's house when I was a child, there was a cat sleeping in their basement
I also had a cage with a bird, rooster, and turkey, I accidentally dropped it while trying to hold it, and that was the end of it :)))
I had it for a while, but whenever it saw me, it would make fun of me, that's why I set it free.
It left and never came back.

The most attractive people I saw were a mix of different countries

Disney College is great, but you have to be a student in America to apply
In Denmark, they throw cinnamon on you for your 25th birthday if you're unmarried.
If you're not married by 30, they throw pepper on you

Today's prayer: God, please bring me out of this country as soon as possible. Amen
Remember, killing three people and chopping them up makes police treat you better than if your scarf slips

I don't want to break the hearts of my friends, but 90% of the tick-tocks you send on Instagram I saw a few days ago in TikTok...
It was only the murder of an unnormalized child that was unexpected.
I wish Twitter had a dislike button
The most surreal cartoon I saw as a child was the one where a train came at night looking for a boy and they went to the North or the South Pole
Reacted to a TikTok video where they were offering $400 to sell plasma, now I'm considering all the different things you can sell and make money with and it makes me happy :))
I'm not taciturn, I just have nothing to say to you.
They write that all the guys show their girlfriends to their friends. Now I don't care about generalizing the subject, but these bitches are upset that ...
To the assholes who were begging for two days until the government gave them two shares, I think whores can't even
The problem starts from accepting your mental and mindset problems as personal traits
My mom came back a few days ago and said we were both born in Aban and have nothing in common, she rejects all these kinds of things - harada...
The best thing about university being free is that when my clever classmates message me I don't swing and relax :)
If you want to help a family, never give them too much money, buy the desired item yourself and give it to them, help them generously...
I rather kill myself than vote for you dears :')

In my opinion, many of the things we say now should not be like this; these are stereotypes, and it should really be like this, and the reason so many people say no and that because they don't want to make the smallest effort.
This should be a daily reminder for a stage of life for humans to come to their senses: https://t.co/waHfJ424jV

In my opinion, each and every Iranian celebrity is hypocritical (except for a very small percentage) because if they were not so famous and didn't have parties, they wouldn't be this high up to criticize the government; they had encountered real hardships before anything else.

I used to dislike football until I went to a concert and saw how good of a speaker he is and with the money he makes, he builds a lot of schools in deprived areas 🥹🥹 When my academic brain heard this, I was like He is the best
Once I had a video call with my friends while I was walking down the street, I told them I feel very lonely here and my situation is not very good. They said just the fact that you can walk on the street like this is a lot. I know they didn't mean anything and don't remember and remind me of what I've been through and where I am now, but it's still painful.

Who in my family is on Twitter? This was our chance :/
Oh God, I am now thinking about what tweets they saw. I was just a small topic in the family before; now I think I have become a huge topic :| It's okay, what can I do. I wish they would block me, but 😭

I don't feel safe anymore. Family, get out of my page 😡😡😡😡 Did they delete the message, meaning they saw this post? :))) Dear God, I wish I had asked for their username to follow them so I could block them myself

Oh :| I think my Twitter reached our family, please block me yourselves 😭😭😭

Saying that AI shouldn't be used is also ridiculous, really :/ I don't understand why everything is so famous, especially among foreigners. What is all this resistance to progress?

For today's excitement, I walked from university to home and back on foot, stumbled at least twenty times, and now even my shoes are completely wet, and my knees hurt now :))

I and my friends have come to the conclusion that the reason people who come into our lives are not normal is that we are not normal ourselves. Now I can live my life with peace of mind.

We went out with friends, and now I'm annoyed that I can't go to space :))) More advanced than myself😂

I looked at myself in the mirror today and felt the wave of my youth slipping away. The saddest part? There’s nothing I can do to stop it.
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changing my machinery and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined
Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
My Roman empire 🥹 https://t.co/fmOwOO6YGt
People whose only criterion for judgment is money scare me
I don't understand exactly what happened that disrespect and foolishness became so normal:)) The leader of a nation and its cool people are so characterless!!! It really makes one wonder
My new passport photo makes me look like a member of ISIS:))
Unfortunately, I am losing my little hope in humanity
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here

I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates, and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey
I just wanted you to know That this is me trying

In the Iranian group in our city, someone wrote, "Please, for preventing depression, let's have a Thursday gathering." Then someone else wrote, "Sadly, the mother of so and so has passed away :|"
I have no connection with this lady, but the irony is really funny😂😂 An Iranian professor can't even get a student from Iran :)))

I went to see my relatives, found a second cousin working at DataBricks in San Francisco:)))))) Should I message him to reform our genetics matching by 2.5%? haha Look where we've ended up, oh God
It's interesting, he mentioned it so accurately. I didn't know and don't know to the extent of how many generations ago they went from Shiraz to Rasht :)) Quite remarkable he mentioned that.

My genetic test result is back, and I'm 100% Persian, at your service :))))
If you don't know English, why create an English conversation course? :)

I give myself a 10/10 rating✨ https://t.co/Qjk4dv5XIh
I'm afraid one day the song "Siah Sookhte" becomes so popular that they cancel Gilakar:)))))

I was reading all the right and left analyses and came across an interesting point: the reason many people switched from the left to the right was that the left became heavily involved in perfectionism and started attacking everything and everyone, canceling in every possible way.

The name of the group they took from me😂😂 They kept asking me to give alternatives for cool friends and in short, they named it cool friends :)) https://t.co/rtAfWsJ0fP

Years ago, I wanted to have a 24-hour birthday celebration for my 24th birthday, but this year I totally forgot about it, I wanted to do this. Oh well, too bad, there was no one to argue with, it didn't make much of a difference that I forgot:)))

The stories of the Mormons in Utah are also very dark

Some Twitter threads that I want to start but my situation doesn't allow it, unfortunately, it's just internal feelings. I wish I could get out of this situation to share my interesting mental overflows with you😂
1. Someone wrote a comment about Persianz Torrent mocking an Iranian TicTocker, and the response was, "I don't know, you tell me." Now the comments: la wanna be 😭😭😂😂😂

2. They have a concept in the chat: a 24-hour spa where you can eat, get a massage, and so on, which is interesting.

3. I fought with Tygaru and didn't like it: (

4. I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork, the dominoes cascaded in a line.

5. Unfortunately, the snow has started again :|

6. People who are insecure are terrifying. Many of them enter your life under the guise of friendship, gather data on you, and use it against you to make your life miserable because they think you have something they don't have. The worst part is that you see them as your friends, but they are worse than enemies.
My friend gave me a picture of her VIP pass for the Marilyn Manson concert that her friend won.
The other friend of mine is going to Thailand with her boyfriend.
Another friend of mine has been having a great time with Niagara in the hotel for a few days, and I've been shoveling snow all day. :)))))))
