Thesis Summary
- Title: Performance of Time Series Interpolation Algorithms in the Presence of Noise
- Abstract: Thesis evaluates the Hybrid Wiener Interpolator (HWI) for reconstructing nonstationary time series. Simulation-based comparison against KAF and EWMA under different noise conditions demonstrated HWI’s robustness.
- Methods: HWI, KAF, EWMA, Nearest Neighbor, Linear, Spline Interpolation.
- Simulations and Applications: Surface plots, heatmaps, Sunspot dataset.
- Conclusion: HWI outperforms other methods under noisy and gappy data conditions.
